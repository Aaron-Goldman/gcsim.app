        gcsim is a Monte Carlo combat simulator for Genshin Impact. It attempts
        to simulate (to the best of our knowledge and ability) combat against a
        dummy target over a user specified time frame. If you are a World of
        Warcraft player and you have used SimulationCraft then this app should
        feel right at home.

        How does it work
      </p>
      <p className="p-2">
        The simulator runs on a text based config file (very similar to WoW
        SimC). The config file can be broken down into two parts: the team
        configuration and the actions configuration.

        Team configuration
      </p>
      <p className="p-2">
        To make life easier, the app has a built in team configuration that let
        you pick which character you wish to use as well as their weapons,
        artifacts etc... This is combined with the action list to form the
        config file used by the simulator's core engine

        Actions configuration
      </p>
      <p className="p-2">
        The actions configuration (or action lists) are basically instructions
        that tells the simulator how to play the team you have specified. This
        is the bread and butter of the simulator.
      </p>
      <p className="p-2">
        The action list comprises of a list of actions in priority sequence that
        the simulator will execute. This is important as the actions are not
        listed in <strong>sequential</strong> order, but rather in{" "}
        <strong>priority</strong>. To put it simply, the simulator decides which
        action to execute based on the first action on the list that has is
        ready and has it's conditions fulfiled every time it needs something to
        execute. This allows for much more flexibility and let's the simulator
        decides conditionally on what to use next, similar to how an actual
        player may play. For anyone coming from WoW SimC, this should be no
        stranger to you.

        simulator (for non character specific events) and by each character.

        information!). So be sure to check out what other information there are.
